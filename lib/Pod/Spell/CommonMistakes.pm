=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module looks for any typos in your POD. It differs from L<Pod::Spell> or L<Test::Spelling> because it uses a custom wordlist and doesn't
use the system spellchecker. The idea for this came from the L<http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Lintian> code in Debian, thanks!

To use this, just pass it a filename that has POD in it and you'll get a hashref back. If the hashref is empty that means the checker found
no misspelled words. If it contains keys, then the keys are the bad words and the values are the suggested spelling.

=head1 Methods

=head2 check_pod( $filename )

This function is what you will usually run. It will run the spell checks against the POD in $filename. Warning: you would need to catch any
exceptions thrown from this function!

It returns a hashref of misspelled words and their suggested spelling. If the hash is empty then there is no errors in the POD.

=head2 check_pod_case( $filename )

This function behaves the same as check_pod() but it uses a "strict" wordlist instead. The difference is that this wordlist
will make sure you capitalize common terms properly. One example is: OpenLdap => OpenLDAP.

NOTE: This does NOT run the same checks as check_pod()! If you want to check both the regular and picky wordlists, you would need to use
the check_pod_all() function.

=head2 check_pod_all( $filename )

This function behaves the same as check_pod() but it runs all the extra checks too. Currently it's just the picky wordlist but others might
be added in the future...

=head1 EXPORT

You would need to manually get the function you want.
